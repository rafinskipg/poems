I bring you flowers from the dark
either you are dead or alive
I bring you flowers from the dark
in this moment of space and time
your lips, your hair, all your atoms shine
I bring you flowers from the dark
Let me love you as you were mine
touch you gently and kiss your eyes
thus this expirience i call life
never imprisoned me so hard
I painfully love the way you smile,
I will treasure it in my mind
even knowing you are going to die
sometime
I bring you flowers from the dark
